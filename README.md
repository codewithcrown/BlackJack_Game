Blackjack Game
This is a Python implementation of the popular Blackjack card game. Players aim to beat the dealer by getting a hand value as close to 21 as possible without going over.

Features
Single Player: Allows only one player to compete against the dealer.
Dealer: The dealer follows traditional blackjack rules, hitting until their hand value is at least 17.
Card Deck: The game uses a standard 52-card deck, which is shuffled at the start of the game.
Simple User Interface: The game runs in the terminal with clear prompts and instructions.
Winning Conditions: Players win by getting a higher hand value than the dealer without exceeding 21 or by the dealer going bust.



How to Play
Start the Game: When the game starts, each player is dealt two cards, and the dealer is dealt two cards (one face-up and one face-down).
Player Actions: Players can choose to:
Hit: Draw another card.
Stand: Keep their current hand and end their turn.
Dealer's Turn: After all players have finished their turns, the dealer reveals their hidden card and draws cards until their total is 17 or higher.
Winning Conditions: Players win if:
Their hand value is higher than the dealerâ€™s without exceeding 21.
The dealer exceeds 21 (goes bust), and the player does not.
Players automatically lose if their hand exceeds 21 (bust).

Add support for splitting hands and doubling down.
